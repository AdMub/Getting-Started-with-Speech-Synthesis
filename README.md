### Overview
Speech synthesis, or Text-to-Speech (TTS), is transforming how we interact with technology. This repository is part of a campaign designed to guide you through the principles of TTS, explore advanced models, and create an interactive application using the Coqui TTS library. By completing the quests, you'll gain hands-on experience and practical knowledge of TTS.

     TTS allows computers to "speak".


### Repository Structure
The repository is organized into three main quests, each building on the previous one:

## Quest 1: Exploring TTS Concepts
Understand the foundational concepts of TTS, including models, speakers, and languages.

# Scripts:
languages_1.py: Explore available language options.
models_1.py: Familiarize yourself with TTS models.
speakers_1.py: Experiment with speaker configurations.
tts-app_1.py: Test a basic TTS application.
tts-script_1.py: Generate speech from text using the basics.

## Quest 2: Deep Dive into TTS Models
Learn to customize and save TTS outputs while refining configurations.

# Scripts:
languages_2.py
models_2.py
speakers_2.py
tts-app_2.py
tts-script_2.py

Deliverables: Save generated audio outputs in .wav format.

## Quest 3: Building a GenAI TTS App
Combine knowledge from earlier quests to build a functional and interactive TTS application with Gradio.

# Scripts:
languages_3.py
models_3.py
speakers_3.py
tts-app_3.py
tts-script_3.py
# Features:
Text input, voice selection, waveform visualization, and real-time audio playback.


### Learning Outcomes

Understanding TTS principles and real-world applications.
Generating natural-sounding speech with the Coqui TTS library.
Customizing speakers, languages, and configurations.
Developing an interactive TTS application using Gradio.


### Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher.
Basic understanding of programming concepts.
A virtual environment setup (recommended).


### Installation
## Clone the Repository:
bash:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/speech-synthesis-campaign.git
cd speech-synthesis-campaign

## Set Up a Virtual Environment:
bash:
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

## Install Dependencies:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage
## Run a TTS Script
bash
python tts-script_<quest_number>.py
Replace <quest_number> with 1, 2, or 3 to match the desired quest.


# Modify Parameters:
Adjust text, speaker, and language configurations in the scripts to explore features.

# Generate and Save Audio Outputs:
Outputs will be saved in the output/ directory.

# Run the Gradio App:
For Quest 3, launch the interactive application:
bash:
python tts-app_3.py

### Features
Interactive Gradio Application (Quest 3)

## Input Options:
Text entry for speech synthesis.
Voice and language selection.

## Outputs:
Audio playback and download.
Visualized waveform analysis.
Advanced Features:
Real-time feedback.
Data insights (e.g., word count, duration).

## Customizations
Model Selection: Use models.py to select models.
Speaker Configuration: Customize voices in speakers.py.
Language Customization: Choose accents and pronunciations via languages.py.

### Project Roadmap
## Quest 1: Foundations of TTS
Learn the basics of text analysis and vocoders.
## Quest 2: Advanced TTS Models
Refine speaker and language configurations.
## Quest 3: Interactive GenAI TTS
Build and deploy a full-fledged TTS application.
